# Week 1 Tutorial
---

## Welcome to 1511!

- Super fun course, BUT lots of work!
- Great for both coding newbies (like me when I did 1511) AND mega programming
  nerds (like me now)!
- Hope you enjoy the course!

## Part 1: Introductions

1. Get into **groups of 3-4**.
2. Introduce everyones names.
3. Chat and find the **Most obscure thing that everyone has in common**.
    - e.g. "doing 1511 this term" is in common, but not very obscure.
4. **Nominate someone to represent your group** -> they will introduce everyone by name and
   the thing in common to the rest of the class.

## Part 2: Information + QnA

### Course Structure?
- Turn up to: **Lectures, Tutorials, Labs**
- Get marks from: **Weekly Problem Sets, Assignments, Exam**

### Need help?
- **Forum:** programming questions
- **Help Sessions:** face to face, 1 on 1 help
- **My Email/Teams:** Class specific stuff or personal issues (aka, struggling to
  keep up).

### How to go well!
- Turn up to class -> even if you are "behind"
- Do all the labs (free marks)
- Just code ALOT!
- Ask for help regularly
- *Things that don't really help: writing excessive notes, rewatching lectures,
  being stuck on a bug for hours*

## Part 3: Introduction to Linux

Together we will:
- Look around at the coding environment
- Difference between the Terminal and the Text editor
- Some terminal commands

## Part 4: CODING TOGETHER!

Together we will: 
- Code up a classic "hello world" program
- Code up a program that acts a bit like this:

```
$ dcc print_face.c -o print_face
$ ./print_face
  ~ ~
  0 0
   o
   -
```

## Part 5: Going to the lab

- When in the lab, google: **comp1511 cgi** -> **check that the url says "24T2"**
  (blue website).
- Pair Programming:
    - Find someone to be your **programming buddy**
    - Let me know who your buddies are during the lab -> we can mix it up
      halfway thorugh the term 
    - **You can submit the exact same
      code**
