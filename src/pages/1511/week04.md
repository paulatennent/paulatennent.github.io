## Part 1: Arrays Demo

Lets see how we go debugging the code on the board?

## Part 2: Arrays Practice

**TASK - Pairs**

Code up one of the following programs:

1. **No Negatives**
    - Create an array with 8 elements - positive and negative
    - Print out the array

2. **Largest Character**
    - Create an array of 8 elements
    - Loop through the array to find the largest element
    - Print out the element

## Part 3: Functions

I'll demo some function code!

## Part 4: Functions Practice

**TASK - Pairs**

Decide on one of the following exercises to code up:

1. A function that prints out "hello world"
2. A function that takes in 2 integer (hour and minute) and prints out `"The current time is __:__\n"` 
2. A function that takes in an integer and returns the negative of it.
3. A function that prints out an array.
4. A function that takes in an array returns the largest element.
  exists)

**Guide to making functions**
1. Determine the **function name**
2. Add it to your main function -> pretend it exists
3. Create the function layout
4. Fill in inputs + outputs
5. Fill in the body
